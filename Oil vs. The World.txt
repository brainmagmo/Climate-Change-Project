Description:
In this project we will explore the relationship between population density, oil consumption, and global warming, broken down by geographic areas in the United States.


Questions:
What is the relationship between population density and oil consumption? For one city? For multiple cities? By country.
Does an increase in oil consumption correlate with a rise in the average temperature of the world?
Are denser countries/cities using less oil?

Extreme weather events (count/severity/cost impact) vs global temperature?
Is climate change localized?

Fossil fuel consumption vs gloabal temperature over time?



Datasets:
-oil consumption
-fossil consumption by country - Thompson
-temperature
-population density by country - Sagar
-$ for public transit/population - Trevor

Region consumption

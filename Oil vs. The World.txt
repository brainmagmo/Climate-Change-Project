Description:
In this project we will explore the relationship between population density, oil consumption, and global warming, broken down by geographic areas in the United States.


Questions:
What is the relationship between population density and oil consumption? For one city? For multiple cities? By country.
> What is the relationship between population density and energy consumption?

Does an increase in oil consumption correlate with a rise in the average temperature of the world?
> Does an increase in energy consumption correlate with a rise in the average temperature of the world?


Extreme weather events (count/severity/cost impact) vs global temperature?

Extreme weather events vs transit?

Energy consumption vs transit?

Extreme weather vs energy consumption?

Is climate change localized?

Fossil fuel consumption vs gloabal temperature over time?

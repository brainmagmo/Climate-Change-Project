Description:
In this project we will explore the relationship between population density, oil consumption, and global warming, broken down by geographic areas in the United States.


Questions:
What is the relationship between population density and oil consumption? For one city? For multiple cities?
Does an increase in oil consumption correlate with a rise in the average temperature of the world?
Are denser cities using less oil?


Datasets:
-oil consumption
-temperature
-population density
